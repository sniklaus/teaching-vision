# demosaic numpyInput by using convolutions to mimic bilinear interpolation as shown in the slides and described in section 3.3

# the input has the following beyer pattern, id est that the top left corner is red

# RGRGRG ....
# GBGBGB ....
# RGRGRG ....
# GBGBGB ....
# ...........
# ...........

# to do this using convolutions, the first step is to separate the colors from numpyInput into four channels such that numpyOutput[:, :, 1] for example becomes

# 0G0G0G ....
# G0G0G0 ....
# 0G0G0G ....
# G0G0G0 ....
# ...........
# ...........

# since this can be tricky and you might not be perfectly familiar with indexing and splicing matrices yet, this is already done for you below

numpyOutput = numpy.zeros([ numpyInput.shape[0], numpyInput.shape[1], 3 ], numpy.float32)

numpyOutput[1::2, 1::2, 0] = numpyInput[1::2, 1::2]
numpyOutput[0::2, 1::2, 1] = numpyInput[0::2, 1::2]
numpyOutput[1::2, 0::2, 1] = numpyInput[1::2, 0::2]
numpyOutput[0::2, 0::2, 2] = numpyInput[0::2, 0::2]

# for each channel in numpyOutput, use a suitable convolution to perform the demosaicing and store the output back in its respective channel in numpyOutput
# we already discussed in class what the appropriate kernel for the green channel is, determining the kernel for the other two channels is up to you
# to be able to convolve a channel from numpyOutput and storing the result back in the same channel, the convolution must not affect the resolution
# we need padding for the convolution to not affect the resolution, this is already built into OpenCV but make sure to use cv2.BORDER_DEFAULT as the border type
