numpyInput = cv2.imread(filename='./samples/demosaicing.png', flags=cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE).astype(numpy.float32) / 255.0

# demosaic numpyInput by using bilinear interpolation as shown in the slides and described in section 3.3

# the input has the following beyer pattern, id est that the top left corner is red

# RGRGRG ....
# GBGBGB ....
# RGRGRG ....
# GBGBGB ....
# ...........
# ...........

# the straightforward way that i see for doing this (there are others as well though) is to iterate over each pixel and resolving each of the four possible cases
# to simplify this, you can iterate from (1 to numpyInput.shape[0] - 1) and (1 to numpyInput.shape[1] - 1) to avoid corner cases, numpyOutput is accordingly one pixel smaller on each side

numpyOutput = numpy.zeros([ numpyInput.shape[0] - 2, numpyInput.shape[1] - 2, 3 ], numpy.float32)

# notice that to fill in the missing greens, you will always be able to take the average of four neighboring values
# however, depending on the case, you either get four or only two neighboring values for red and blue
# this is perfectly fine, in this case you can simply use the average of two values if only two neighbors are available
